# ⚛️ Small React Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small React exercises and practice projects. It helped me improve my React skills through hands-on experimentation with components, hooks, state management, and other React fundamentals.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice React basics and advanced topics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (functional components & hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
